            <h2>Welcome</h2>
            <p>My name is Valentino and I am a Junior Software Developer who specialises in Web and Android Development.
            </p>
            <p>I am a self-taught Developer, with almost one year experience developing. I am currently focusing on
                Front-End Development and aspiring to be a Full-Stack Developer. This website contains information about
                me, my resume, portfolio, stories, and ways to stay in touch or contact me.</p>

                <p>When I’m not studying on website projects, I like to spend my time learning new things.
                    I love learning new things and expanding my knowledge and putting what I’ve learned into practice.
                    To help me in my web design learning journey, I love to read books, enroll in online courses and,
                    of course, follow some very reliable websites for my source of information.
                    Most are crammed with knowledge, tips, tricks, free tutorials, resources, and valuable information
                    on web design and development. Are you ready to expand your knowledge as a budding web developer
                    too?
